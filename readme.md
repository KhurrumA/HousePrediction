# House Price Prediction

This project predicts house prices using the Boston Housing dataset, employing advanced machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model comparison, hyperparameter tuning, feature importance analysis, and residual evaluation.

## Key Features

1. **Feature Engineering**: Transforming and adding new features, such as the log-transformed 'CRIM' column.
2. **Model Comparison**: Evaluating models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Regressor.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing the Random Forest model using GridSearchCV.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Performance metrics like R², MAE, MSE, and RMSE.
5. **Feature Importance**: Analyzing and visualizing the significance of each feature.
6. **Residual Analysis**: Checking the model’s residuals for bias.
